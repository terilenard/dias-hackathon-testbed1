.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]tpm2_stirrandom\f[R](1) \- Add \[lq]additional information\[rq]
into TPM RNG state.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tpm2_stirrandom\f[R] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] [\f[I]ARGUMENT\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]tpm2_stirrandom\f[R](1) \- Inject \[lq]additional information\[rq]
as bytes into TPM entropy Protected Capability pool.
.PP
\[lq]Additional information\[rq] can be extracted from file specified as
argument or being read from \f[I]STDIN\f[R] if argument is not
specified.
.PP
Up to 128 bytes can be injected at once through standard input to
\f[B]tpm2_stirrandom\f[R](1).
.PP
If input file is larger than 128 bytes, \f[B]tpm2_stirrandom\f[R](1)
will fail.
.PP
Adding data through \f[B]tpm2_stirrandom\f[R](1) will trigger a
reseeding of TPM DRBG Protected Capability.
It is used when performing any sensitive action on a shielded location
such as loading a persistent key or acting on a Protected Capability
like updating TPM firmware.

.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.PP
This collection of options are common to many programs and provide
information that many users may expect.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-h\f[R], \f[B]\-\-help=[man|no\-man]\f[R]: Display the tools
manpage.
By default, it attempts to invoke the manpager for the tool, however, on
failure will output a short tool summary.
This is the same behavior if the \[lq]man\[rq] option argument is
specified, however if explicit \[lq]man\[rq] is requested, the tool will
provide errors from man on stderr.
If the \[lq]no\-man\[rq] option if specified, or the manpager fails, the
short options will be output to stdout.
.RS 2
.PP
To successfully use the manpages feature requires the manpages to be
installed or on \f[I]MANPATH\f[R], See man(1) for more details.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-v\f[R], \f[B]\-\-version\f[R]: Display version information for
this tool, supported tctis and exit.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-V\f[R], \f[B]\-\-verbose\f[R]: Increase the information that the
tool prints to the console during its execution.
When using this option the file and line number are printed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-Q\f[R], \f[B]\-\-quiet\f[R]: Silence normal tool output to
stdout.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-Z\f[R], \f[B]\-\-enable\-errata\f[R]: Enable the application of
errata fixups.
Useful if an errata fixup needs to be applied to commands sent to the
TPM.
Defining the environment TPM2TOOLS_ENABLE_ERRATA is equivalent.
information many users may expect.
.SH TCTI Configuration
.PP
The TCTI or \[lq]Transmission Interface\[rq] is the communication
mechanism with the TPM.
TCTIs can be changed for communication with TPMs across different
mediums.
.PP
To control the TCTI, the tools respect:
.IP "1." 3
The command line option \f[B]\-T\f[R] or \f[B]\-\-tcti\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
The environment variable: \f[I]TPM2TOOLS_TCTI\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The command line option always overrides the environment
variable.
.PP
The current known TCTIs are:
.IP \[bu] 2
tabrmd \- The resource manager, called
tabrmd (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd).
Note that tabrmd and abrmd as a tcti name are synonymous.
.IP \[bu] 2
mssim \- Typically used for communicating to the TPM software simulator.
.IP \[bu] 2
device \- Used when talking directly to a TPM device file.
.IP \[bu] 2
none \- Do not initalize a connection with the TPM.
Some tools allow for off\-tpm options and thus support not using a TCTI.
Tools that do not support it will error when attempted to be used
without a TCTI connection.
Does not support \f[I]ANY\f[R] options and \f[I]MUST BE\f[R] presented
as the exact text of \[lq]none\[rq].
.PP
The arguments to either the command line option or the environment
variable are in the form:
.PP
\f[C]<tcti\-name>:<tcti\-option\-config>\f[R]
.PP
Specifying an empty string for either the \f[C]<tcti\-name>\f[R] or
\f[C]<tcti\-option\-config>\f[R] results in the default being used for
that portion respectively.
.SS TCTI Defaults
.PP
When a TCTI is not specified, the default TCTI is searched for using
\f[I]dlopen(3)\f[R] semantics.
The tools will search for \f[I]tabrmd\f[R], \f[I]device\f[R] and
\f[I]mssim\f[R] TCTIs \f[B]IN THAT ORDER\f[R] and \f[B]USE THE FIRST ONE
FOUND\f[R].
You can query what TCTI will be chosen as the default by using the
\f[B]\-v\f[R] option to print the version information.
The \[lq]default\-tcti\[rq] key\-value pair will indicate which of the
aforementioned TCTIs is the default.
.SS Custom TCTIs
.PP
Any TCTI that implements the dynamic TCTI interface can be loaded.
The tools internally use \f[I]dlopen(3)\f[R], and the raw
\f[I]tcti\-name\f[R] value is used for the lookup.
Thus, this could be a path to the shared library, or a library name as
understood by \f[I]dlopen(3)\f[R] semantics.
.SH TCTI OPTIONS
.PP
This collection of options are used to configure the various known TCTI
modules available:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]device\f[R]: For the device TCTI, the TPM character device file for
use by the device TCTI can be specified.
The default is \f[I]/dev/tpm0\f[R].
.RS 2
.PP
Example: \f[B]\-T device:/dev/tpm0\f[R] or \f[B]export
\f[BI]TPM2TOOLS_TCTI\f[B]=\[lq]device:/dev/tpm0\[rq]\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]mssim\f[R]: For the mssim TCTI, the domain name or IP address and
port number used by the simulator can be specified.
The default are 127.0.0.1 and 2321.
.RS 2
.PP
Example: \f[B]\-T mssim:host=localhost,port=2321\f[R] or \f[B]export
\f[BI]TPM2TOOLS_TCTI\f[B]=\[lq]mssim:host=localhost,port=2321\[rq]\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]abrmd\f[R]: For the abrmd TCTI, the configuration string format is
a series of simple key value pairs separated by a `,' character.
Each key and value string are separated by a `=' character.
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
TCTI abrmd supports two keys:
.RS 2
.IP "1." 3
`bus_name' : The name of the tabrmd service on the bus (a string).
.IP "2." 3
`bus_type' : The type of the dbus instance (a string) limited to
`session' and `system'.

.SH NOTES
.PP
Please be aware that even if the \[lq]additional information\[rq] added
by \f[B]tpm2_stirrandom\f[R](1) can be entropy gathered from other DRBG
sources, the TPM has no way of determining if the value has any entropy
or not.
As a consequence, it will just be considered as \[lq]additional
input\[rq].
.PP
The \[lq]additional input\[rq] is as defined in NIST
SP800\-90A (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-90.pdf)
