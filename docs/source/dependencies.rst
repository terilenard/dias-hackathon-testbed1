Testbed dependencies
====================

Each component in the testbed has several dependencies. This document describes what dependencies are necessary to be installed in order to configure other modules.


Preliminaries
`````````````
Run a update:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Install git:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install git

Have a local copy of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/terilenard/dias-hackathon-testbed1.git
    
To update the local copy, you can run the following command from the project root directory:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    git submodule update --init â€“recursive
    
In the project, there is a *toolchain* directory that contains scripts that can be used to install dependencies and modules. In the *dependencies* directory, there are linked the libraries used in the testbed.


Controller Area Network Configuration
`````````````````````````````````````
The current section describes the Controller Area Network (CAN) configuration required for each component.

Electronic Control Unit and Connectivity Control Unit
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following steps must be done on each component.

Requirements:

* MCP2515 CAN controller with TJA1050 CAN Transceiver
* One virtual CAN (vcan)
* One physical CAN (can1/can0)

To setup vcan go to project root:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    cd dias-hackathon-testbed1

Run the setup script for vcan:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    cd toolchain/scripts
    
Install can-utils:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install can-utils

The following script will create a *vcan0* interface and will configure it to be up on boot:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    ./vcan.sh
    
The *vcan0* interface should be visable in *ip link*:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    ip link

To setup the can interface with the MCP2515 controller you need to modify the boot/config.txt file on your image, and copy the dt overlay file:

Boot/config.txt used. In this case the MCP2515 is connected along a physical TPM:

.. code-block:: bash

    dtparam=spi=on
    dtoverlay=spi1-1cs,cs0_pin=16,cs0_spidev=off
    dtoverlay=mcp2515-can2,oscillator=8000000,interrupt=26
    # TPM 
    dtoverlay=tpm-slb9670
 
.. note::
    The *tpm-slb9670* should be present in */boot/overlay* after you compile the *tpm2-tss* library.
    
Copy dtoverlay:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    cd toolchain/utils/rpi3-mcp2515/

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo cp mcp2515-can2.dtbo /boot/overlays
    
For the CAN interface to be up on boot, your */etc/network/interfaces* should look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    auto can1
    iface can1 inet manual
        pre-up /sbin/ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000 loopback off restart-ms 100
        up /sbin/ifconfig can1 up
        down /sbin/ifconfig can1 down

.. note::
    Please check in *ip link* after a reboot what index you *can* interface has. In the case the index does       not match the configuration in */etc/network/interfaces* should be changed accordingly. For example, from     *can1* to *can0*.


Trusted Platform Module Configuration
`````````````````````````````````````

Both the *ECU* and *CCU* require the *tpm2-tss* libraries and the *tpm2-tools* utilities. The *tss.sh* script installs the required TPM2 dependencies together with the TPM2-ABRMD resource manager. This script will also compile and install IBM's Virtual TPM. If you have a physical TPM2, there are below some command that will help you disable IBM Virtual TPM and use the dedicated one instead.

The install script is located in *toolchain/scripts*. From there you can execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tss.sh
    
To verify if everything went ok run a tpm2 command to check:

.. code-block:: bash

    tpm2_getcap -l
    
.. warning::
    If the *tpm2_xxx* tools are not found. We suggest to follow the manual instalation below. If you can run       your commands then you should skip the command below that manually compile tpm2_tools.

Go to working directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd dependencies/tpm2-tools-4.3.2/

Create the build directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build

Bootstrap and configure:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./bootstrap

.. code-block:: bash
    
    ./configure

Compile:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    make

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo make install

Compared to a physical TPM, which is exposed as a linux device, the virtual TPM exposes socket which allows similar interactions with it. Next, we must configure the TPM resource manager (tpm2-abrmd) to connect to the port opened by the tpm_server, and not to the default */dev/tpm0* device. This requires some changes on the tpm2-abrmd service unit.

If you followed a similar configuration with the one in this guide, the service file should be located in */usr/local/lib/systemd/system/tpm2-abrmd.service*.

.. code-block:: bash

        [Unit]                                          
        Description=TPM2 Access Broker and Resource Management Daemon        
        # These settings are needed when using the device TCTI. If the        
        # TCP mssim is used then the settings should be commented out.        
        - After=dev-tpm0.device
        + #After=dev-tpm0.device
        - Requires=dev-tpm0.device
        + #Requires=dev-tpm0.device
        [Service]
        Type=dbus                                                                                                                                                               BusName=com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd                                                                                                                                           - ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/tpm2-abrmd
        + ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/tpm2-abrmd --tcti=mssim:host=localhost,port=2321
        User=tss
        [Install]                                                                                                                                                               WantedBy=multi-user.target  


After modifying the file, we must reload the service using:

.. code-block:: bash

        sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Last but not least, *cd* to the *tpm2-abrmd* downloaded repository and move the following file so the *tss* can access the dbus:

.. code-block:: bash

        sudo cp dist/tpm2-abrmd.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/tpm2-abrmd.conf 

the tpm2-abrmd.conf should look like this:

.. code-block:: bash
        <busconfig>
          <policy user="tss">
            <allow own="com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd"/>
          </policy>
          <policy user="root">
            <allow own="com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd"/>
          </policy>
          <policy context="default">
            <allow send_destination="com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd"/>
            <allow receive_sender="com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd"/>
          </policy>
        </busconfig>

Change the /dev/tpm0 ownership to tss:

.. code-block:: bash

        sudo chown tss:tss /dev/tpm0

Now, we can restart the *tpm2-abrmd* and he will try to connect on port *2321* on *localhost* to a virtual tpm.


MQTT Broker - Mosquitto
```````````````````````

Install mosquitto:

.. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install mosquitto

Mosquitto Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On both ECU and CCU, go to */etc/mosquitto* and create a *passwords* file. To add a mosquitto username and password you should use *mosquitto_passwd*. For more details check the *man mosquitto_passwd*.
